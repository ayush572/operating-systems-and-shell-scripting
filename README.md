# operating-systems-and-shell-scripting
* This repository has been created in order to update about the operating system and the learning of shell scripting as well

**18/12/22**
* Learnt about the types of OS, what is OS and threading in it.

**19/12/22**
* Learn't more about the context switching, kernel and user and kernel threads.

**20/12/22**
* Learn't about process states, process control block, process scheduler as well.

**21/12/22**
* Learn't about the various scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, Shortest Job first search (both preemptive and non-preemptive), Priority scheduling (preemptive and non-preemptive) and Round Robin Scheduling algorithm.

**22/12/22**
* Learn't about Multilevel queue scheduling and multilevel queue scheduling with feedback. Also started with the deadlock, why it can happen and methods for deadlock prevention. 

**26/12/22**
* Learn't about the Bankers algorithm and deadlock finding out and recovery as well

**27/12/22**
* Learn't about process synchronization, why is it important, how does a system uffers from process inconsistency and methods of overcoming it via process synchronization. Started with semaphores as well.

**29/12/22**
* Learn't about the implementation of semaphores, its working and Monitors in process synchronization

**30/12/22**
* Learn't about the priority inversion and how its handled. Also learn't about that how the programs are compiled and run and also about the memory management in Operating Systems.

**1/1/23**
* Learn't about the address and runtime binding. Also covered the evolution of memory management for single processes to multiple processes. Static Partitioning completed. Covered the basics of dynamic partitioning and the best fit, first fit, next fit and worst fit algorithms. Started with paging concept.

**2/1/23**
* Completed the paging concept and detailed working along with virtual memory as well. Only thing left now is the segmentation and segmentation with paging.

**3/1/23**
* Completed all the topics of "Introduction to operating systems."
* Done with segmentationa and segmentation with paging as well!
